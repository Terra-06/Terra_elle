## **_Description_**

#### A _DJ Record Pool_, is a large curated library of promotional music that DJs can access whenever they need some extra tunes for gigs and shows. Rather than purchasing tracks individually, DJs pay for a monthly or yearly subscription that makes it easy to select, download and use the tracks they selected. Although DJ pools are intended mainly for club DJs, they are ideal for regular gigs also. <br>

## **_How Pure-DJ Works_**

#### Verification is often implemented to prevent people from using the record pools as an alternative to music streaming services. DJ record pools sometimes can receive tracks before their official release and moreover they have a different method of financial settlement with the music suppliers than the streaming services do. Because of that in some cases simple user verification may be required during the sign in process..<br>
